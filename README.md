# Jira Clone Bug Tracker üêû

A simple, lightweight bug tracking application built with **Django**. This project mimics the basic functionality of a Jira Kanban board, allowing users to track, manage, and assign bugs across three primary stages: **Open**, **In Progress**, and **Resolved/Closed**.

## üöÄ Features

* **Kanban View:** Visual organization of bugs across three columns: **Open**, **In Progress**, and **Resolved/Closed**.
* **Built-in Authentication:** Leverages Django's robust user system for secure access and bug assignment.
* **Detailed Bug View:** Users can click "View Details" to see comprehensive information about a bug.
* **Self-Assignment:** Users can assign bugs to themselves from the detailed view, transitioning the bug's status to "In Progress."
* **Priority and Status Tracking:** Each bug displays its priority (e.g., High, Low, Critical) and current status.
* **Admin Panel Integration:** Project managers and administrators can use the built-in Django Admin site to create new bugs, manage users, and update details.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

* **Backend:** Python, Django
* **Database:** Default SQLite 
* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS (with Bootstrap)
